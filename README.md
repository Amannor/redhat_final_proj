# Project Name
This is the code for the final project in the course "Workshop: Projects with the Industry and Academia" (IDC, Herzliya August 2021)

This project is a part of the [Data Science Working Group](http://datascience.codeforsanfrancisco.org) at [Code for San Francisco](http://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org).  Other DSWG projects can be found at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/sfbrigade/data-science-wg).

#### -- Project Status: [Active, On-Hold, Completed]

## Project Intro/Objective

The purpose of this project is to be a POC in test prioritization as part of a CI\CD cycle.
More specifically, in this project we aimed at showing the feasibility  of a specific test prioritization scheme in a Red Hat project.
The test prioritization scheme is based on the article ["Selective Test Prediction" by Facebook reseacrh](https://research.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Predictive-Test-Selection.pdf) (hereinafter referd to as "the FB article").
The Red Hat product is the [Openshift project](https://github.com/openshift/origin)


##Background

This project is a POC in test prioritization as part of a CI\CD process. The idea was to show that the methodolgy described in the FB article can be implemented in Red Hat software products. Most of this

- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)
